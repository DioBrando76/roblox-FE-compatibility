Small disclaimer: This code is not 100% reliable, and it may not work for some scripts.

How to use:

0. Get main.lua
1. Insert at the beginning of the script
2. Run script on server-side (h/, r/)

Thats probably it, idk

Note: some scripts require additional editing, for example scripts that parent instance to player.
In that case, use RealPlayer to parent to an actual player object.
