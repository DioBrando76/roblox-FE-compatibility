Small disclaimer: This code is not 100% reliable, and it may not work for some scripts. Also I'm getting somewhat inactive both on github and script builder. If you need to contact me, my discord is Mokiros#0001, I'm always active there.

How to use:

0. Get main.lua or main-min.lua for minified version
1. Insert at the beginning of the script
2. Run script on server-side (h/, r/)

Thats probably it, idk

Note: some scripts require additional editing, for example scripts that parent instance to player.
In that case, use RealPlayer to parent to an actual player object.

It's recommended to use main-min.lua (minified file), because it takes less space and contains no comments.
