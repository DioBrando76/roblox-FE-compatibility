How to use:

0. Get main.lua or main-min.lua for minified version
1. Insert at the beginning of the script
2. Run script on server-side (h/, r/)

Thats probably it, idk

Note: some scripts require additional editing, for example scripts that parent instance to player.
In that case, use RealPlayer to parent to an actual player object.

It's recommended to use main-min.lua (minified file), because it takes less space and contains no comments.
